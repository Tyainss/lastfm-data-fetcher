## Creating a Lastfm Account!

If you're here, it means you most likely don't have a Lastfm account (yet!). Fear not, you're still in time to do so! However, Lastfm will only be able to pick up on the songs you'll listen from now on (plus your last 50 listened tracks). But better late than never!

We'll have to do 2 main things. First, create the Lastfm account. Second, link to your streaming service of preference.

### 1 - Creating account

1. Visit [Last.fm website](https://www.last.fm/)
2. Hit `Sign up` and add the required information
3. Verify your account through the verification email you'll receive.
4. Log in into your freshly created account

### 2 - Link account to streaming service
I'll use Spotify as an example, but most streaming services will work!

1. Open [this link](https://www.last.fm/about/trackmymusic)
2. Scroll down until you find Spotify and click `Connect`
3. Login into your Spotify account and allow the connection

You should now be good to go! Sometimes there might be a delay with the first connection, but you can always repeat this last 3 steps if you're feeling it's taking too long.
